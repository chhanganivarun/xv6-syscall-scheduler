waitx syscall:
    rtime is updated using a function updatestatistics() that is called during trap.c
getpinfo syscall:
    getpinfo is defined and takes value from proc function and ticks

FCFS Scheduling:
    process with least time is found by comparing the values in proc structure

PBS Scheduling:
    Same as FCFS except the comparison was based on ctime

MLFQ Scheduling:
    Here, 5 queues were abstracted using another variable
    in proc struct and in every 1 second, the processes were 
    pushed to a lower priority and every 100 milliseconds, 
    the processes which got less than 25% of runtime during 
    from their start were aged and increased in priority
